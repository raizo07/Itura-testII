# ITURA-V2 — Wellness, Reimagined

Itura is a decentralized wellness platform that blends the power of art, technology, and self-awareness to support mental and emotional well-being. Through AI-guided art therapy sessions, users are encouraged to express their emotional states creatively—generating personalized artwork, engaging in guided meditations, and ultimately minting their creations as NFTs.

Itura offers a unique space for mindful interaction and self-discovery, empowering creatives to take ownership of their wellness journey while preserving their digital expressions on-chain. This repository houses the frontend code for the Itura web application, developed using React, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion for a smooth, responsive, and immersive user experience.
